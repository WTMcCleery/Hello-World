Commits: save over time
Branching: Separate out your pieces you are working on
Cloning:
1. Take what's on cloud and put it on your local computer
But it will matter what branch you checkout
Checkout:
Choose which branch to currently work on - this will automatically change which files are visible on your local computer
Forking: Copy another repository completely, it is yours and changes to your copy do not change the original (it is a new repository)
Collaborations models:
- Shared repository - everyone who has access has control
  - make a branch, edit, push back to the repository and everyone agrees on merge conflicts
- Open source (Fork and Pull) - Any one can fork and edit, but push requests have limited access - repo owner can pull changes
Pull: transfer files between branches
  - Pull Request: opens a discussion to merge conflicts and results in a pull

Resolving Conflicts:
Version on repo (online) is updated, but local copy is not
Committed changes to local copy will not push to repository
You will be asked to resolve conflicts - easy "use me" button on github


Head and Base:
- User 1 creates a repository
- User 2 forks the repo (2's copy is not the original any more)
- If User 2 wants to merge his updated version to User 1:
User 2 repo is "Head"
User 1 repo is "Base"
Pull request will merge from Head to Base
